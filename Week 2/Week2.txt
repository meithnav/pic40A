**Assignment** 
Build a simple company job application page. For simplicity let's consider company to be UCLA.


**Instructions**

1. Layout Structure for the content: 
- Divide your page into three sections: <header>, <main>, and <footer>.


2. Header Section (never confuse header section with head tag. 2 different things)
- Company's name as main heading. (h1)
- Add a `logo image`. I have provided the logo.


3. Main Section
- Company Intro:
    -- Add a <h2> titled “About UCLA”
    -- Write a brief paragraph about the company. Can include text formatting styles tags.

- Requirements List
    -- Add a <h2> titled “Requirements for Opening”
    -- Create an unordered list with 3 “requirements for opening” (e.g., “Must have 2 years of experience,” “Proficiency in JavaScript,” etc.).


- Pay‑Scale Table
    -- Insert a table with headers “Region”, “Role”, and “Pay (k$)”.
    -- Can use the folowing data: 
e.g.
Region 1 | SDE | 100
Region 2 | PM | 100
Region 3 | PM | 95


- Horizontal Divider : Add a horizontal rule (<hr>) to partition content.


- Login Form : The form should have:
    -- a <h4> titled “Enter your details”
    --  two text inputs for "First Name" and "Last Name"
    -- accept file input for "Upload Resume"
    -- drop-down menu to select the "Location"
    -- "age" field to enter numeric age. 
    -- "Relocate" field with radio buttons having items yes/no
    -- a submit <button> labeled “Submit”.
    -- a reset <button> labeled Reset.


NOTE: Does the buttons work? No? So we will make use of ``HTML forms`` now.


4. Footer Section

- Horizontal Divider : Add a horizontal rule (<hr>) to partition from the main.

- Additional Resources Section: 
    -- a <h4> titled “Enter your details”
    -- Create an unordered list having “About”, “Careers”, and “Contact”. Note I don't want the bullets to be seen. How would you remove them?
    -- All the items should be a link pointing to #(dummy) for simplicity.


- Horizontal Divider

- Copyright section. 
    -- In italics, write: “© Your Name, 2025”.


5. Improving our webpage: 

- if you notice in our header the company name and logo are on different lines? why so? How to bring them on the same line?


- Right now form buttons don't work. 
- Additional Form updates --> 
    -- Imporve the structure of the form. all text fields in new line. 
    -- All the text fields must be complusory. Can't submit by leaving anything blank. 
    -- the upload button should only consider file types (pdf,docx) not images. 
    -- Submit should redirect to a `new page` (e.g. index.html or success.html) once clicked.
