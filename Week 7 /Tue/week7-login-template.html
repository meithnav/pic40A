<!-- 

// NOTE: cookies dont typically work with HTML files. We need to maintain a session for that. S  we use: 

1. Go to your folder(command line/terminal)
>> cd path/to/your/folder

2. Start our server
>> python3 -m http.server 8000

3. this is our url(path)
http://localhost:8000/

#### Additional Facts ####

## Cookie Expiration: 
- Cookies expire at the date set using expires or max-age.
- Without an expiration, the cookie is a session cookie and disappears on browser close.


## Cookie Path & Scope
- If path is not set to /, the cookie is available only to the current path.
- Always use path=/ to make cookies accessible across pages (like from login.html to home.html).


## Security Notes
- Never store passwords in cookies in real applications.
- Use HttpOnly and Secure flags (via server-side code) to prevent XSS and other attacks.


## Common Misconceptions / Tricky Issues
❌ Reading cookies doesn’t give a `JSON object` document.cookie returns a `string` like: username=abc; password=123. You must manually parse it using string operations or a helper.

❌ Deleting a cookie requires matching path. You must delete it with the same path you set it with, or the cookie will persist.
